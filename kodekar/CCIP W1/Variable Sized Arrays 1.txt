Variable Sized Arrays 1

Consider an n-element array, a , where each index i in the array contains a reference to an array of k(i) integers (where the value of k(i) varies from array to array).

Given a, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where i denotes an index in array and denotes an index in the array located at a[i]. For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location a[i+1] on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries). Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at a[i]. Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of j (an index in array a[i+1]) and i(an index in the array referenced by a) for a query.

Constraints

All indices in this challenge are zero-based. All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than 1000000.

Output Format

For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index j of the array referenced by a[i+1]. There should be a total of q lines of output.

NOTE ;- If j is negative print Invalid
